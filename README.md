## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a **crypto-event-calendar** integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

First, it's crucial to understand that a crypto-event-calendar itself is typically not a standalone trading platform. Instead, it acts as a **data feed and intelligence engine** that powers an automated trading system.

The entire process can be broken down into three core phases:

1.  **Data Aggregation & Analysis** (The "Brain")
2.  **Strategy Formulation & Signal Generation** (The "Decision")
3.  **Exchange Integration & Order Execution** (The "Action")

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how this integration works in practice.

---

### Phase 1: Data Aggregation & Analysis (The "Brain")

The calendar's primary job is to collect, standardize, and interpret event data.

*   **Data Sources:** It pulls data from a wide array of sources:
    *   **Official Exchange APIs:** Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc., have APIs that announce new listings, trading pair additions, and mainnet launches.
    *   **Project Announcements:** Directly from project blogs, Twitter, Discord, and Telegram channels
